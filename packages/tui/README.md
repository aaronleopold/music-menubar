# music-menubar (TUI)

I know, menubar is in the name and this is a TUI. It's fine, I promise. I'll think of a new name (maybe)

## So, why React?

Because it is cool! Sure, there is a large increase in performace to be made using something like Rust, but a TUI written using React is kind of really neat!

## Current State

Right now, it displays text and lets you quit. Eventually it'll do the stuff, don't worry!

## Installation & Usage

```bash
yarn
yarn dev
```
